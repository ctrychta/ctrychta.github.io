<h2 id="intro">II. Introduction</h2>

<p>
Two new attributes <code>[[likely]]</code> and <code>[[unlikely]]</code> are proposed. These attributes will serve as hints on the likelihood that a subsequent branch is taken.  Compilers may use these hints to improve the code they generate in various ways.  
</p>

<h2>III. Motivation and Scope</h2>

<p>
Compiler's optimizers often have no information relating to branch probability which can lead to suboptimal code generation.  In many cases the excellent dynamic branch predictors on modern processors can make up for this lack of information.  However, in some cases code may execute more slowly than necessary even though the programmer knew the probability of particular branches being executed because they did not have an easy way to communicate this to the compiler.  
</p>

<p>
Several existing compilers including GCC and Clang implement <code>__builtin_expect</code> which can be used to communicate branch probability information to the optimizer <span class="foot"></span><span class="foot"></span>.  Looking at usages of <code>__builtin_expect</code> in the wild it seems that by far most common usage is through defining a <code>likely</code> macro (<code>#define likely(x) __builtin_expect(!!(x), 1)</code>) and an <code>unlikely</code> macro (<code>#define unlikely(x) __builtin_expect(!!(x), 0) </code>).  Probably the largest project that makes use of this functionality is the linux kernel which uses <code>likely</code> over 3,000 times and <code>unlikely</code> over 14,000 times <span class="foot"></span>.  Other large projects using this functionality include Mozilla with over 200 usages of <code>MOZ_LIKELY</code> and over 7,000 usages of <code>MOZ_UNLIKELY</code> and  Chromium which has hundreds of instances of <code>LIKELY</code> and <code>UNLIKELY</code><span class="foot"></span><span class="foot"></span>.
</p>

<p>
Some of the possible code generation improvements from using branch probability hints include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
  Multiple microarchitectures should be able to benefit from reordering basic blocks and branches to improve instruction cache utilization and keep the most common paths in the pipeline<span class="foot"></span>.  These improvements can sometimes be significant.  For example, on x86, macro-fusion/branch fusion can allow for multiple extra instructions to be executed in a single cycle<span class="foot"></span><span class="foot"></span><span class="foot"></span>.
  </li>
  <li>
  It is common for compilers to generate predicated instructions (eg. cmov) likely due to their generally good performance characteristics and resiliency against unpredictable conditions.  Intel recommends against using these instructions for predictable branches due to the overhead of executing both paths of a branch<span class="foot"></span>.  Testing done while writing this proposal did find better performance when using compare/jump instead of cmov for highly predictable branches.
  </li>
  <li>
  Some microarchitectures, such as Power, have branch hints which can override dynamic branch prediction<span class="foot"></span>.
  </li>
  <li>
  AMD recommends structuring code for its processors so that branches are not taken which consumes fewer branch prediction resources and does not incur the prediction-based bubble of a correctly-predicted taken branch<span class="foot"></span>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Since this proposal has made a few claims about the potential to improve the generated code and performance I have created a couple small examples showing the possible benefits.  All testing was performed with the GCC 6.1.1 20160621 compiler and run on a Xeon E3 1245 v3.  All examples were compiled with <code>-O3 -march=haswell</code> plus defines to control behavior and some other test specific flags mentioned below.  Tests were run three times using <code>perf stat</code> and the median value was taken.
</p>

<p>
This <a href="#appendix_A">first example</a> examines clamping integer values into the interval [0, 65535].  The code was compiled without hints and with hints that the values would not need to be adjusted.  The compiled example was then run with various percentages of values that needed to be adjusted.  The below results show that the hinting was able to improve performance when most values were in the expected range, but as more values were outside of the expected range the code compiled with the branch hints became slower then the code compiled without any hints.
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>% values outside [0, 65535] (approx)</th>
    <th>Time (secs) no hint</th>
    <th>Time (secs) <code>unlikely</code></th>

  </tr>
  <tr class="stripe">

    <td>34.53</td>
    <td>36.03</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
The <a href="#appendix_B">next example</a> examines the tradeoffs between using conditional move and compare/jump.  This time the code was compiled without hints, with a hint to expect the comparison to succeed, and with a hint to expect the comparison to fail.  The compiled example was then run with various percentages of values for which the comparison would succeed.  I was unable to get GCC to stop generating conditional move instructions using only <code>__builtin_expect</code> so I compiled with <code>-fno-if-conversion -fno-tree-loop-if-convert</code> to simulate it.  It appears that recent Clang versions will generate code using comparison and jumps based on the usage of <code>__builtin_expect</code><span class="foot"></span>.
</p>

<p>
The results show that if almost all values (99%+) will take a particular branch then generating a comparison and branch is better.  When the data is slightly more random, generating a conditional move can be much better than branching code.  For the 50% case I saw that over 20% of branches were mispredicted for the cases using branch instructions.
</p>

<p>
The preceding examples show that allowing the programmer to specify branch hints can lead to improved code generation and decreased run time.  Due to these potential benefits this proposal aims to standardize the common likely/unlikely usage pattern so it can be used in a portable manner across compilers without macros. It also hopes to serve as encouragement for more compilers to implement this functionality.       
</p>

<h2 id="impact">IV. Impact On the Standard</h2>

<p>
This proposal has minimal impact on the current standard as it proposes two new attributes which do not change program semantics.
</p>

<h2 id="design">V. Design Decisions</h2>

<p>
<em>Question #1:</em> Why does this proposal not mimic <code>__builtin_expect</code> more closely?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
From the existing usages that I have seen and my own experience it seems that <code>__builtin_expect</code> is rarely used by itself.  It is almost always used as <code>likely/unlikely</code> macros so that is what I decided to propose.  If there are other use cases the committee would like to see supported which require functionality more similar to <code>__builtin_expect</code> this proposal can certainly be updated.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<em>Question #2:</em> Why should branch hints be standardized when many compilers implement PGO?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Branch hints are definitely not meant to replace PGO; if PGO can be used it should be.  PGO may be able to give the optimizer even more information then a branch hint.  However, PGO and branch hints do not need to be mutually exclusive; branch hints could act as another indicator of expected frequent usage of particular branches.
</p>
<p>
Also, PGO is not always easy to use.  PGO necessitates creating a realistic test scenario to profile which, depending on the application, may be difficult and opens up the possibility that some important real world usage may be missed.  The additional build tooling to keep the profile up to date, particularly across multiple OS's and compilers may also be challenging. 
</p>
<p>
Additionally, certain kinds of applications, such as ones which may be distributed to clients who then build and run their own plugins in the distributed application may be very difficult or impossible to generate a realistic benchmark for as there is no way of knowing how the client will use the application.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<em>Question #3:</em> Can this feature easily result in code pessimization?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Yes, as shown by the conditional move example misusing a branch hint can definitely result in worse code with a much larger run time.  This feature is primarily meant to be used after a profiler has shown a hotspot in existing code.  It is not meant to be added to code just because a programmer "thinks" it will help.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<em>Question #4:</em> Why were the names <code>likely/unlikely</code> chosen?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
These names seem to be the most common ones found in existing code bases using this functionality.  I expect the names will receive a lot of bikeshedding and will certainly update the proposal if the consensus is to use different names.
</p>
